                <p className="font-medium">Fluent is the Design language of Microsoft, and serves as the foundation for our Design System, synthesized 
                    through the lens of the unique needs of our customers. We are also part of a federated community of Systems 
                    Teams from across the company that share similar patterns, platforms, requirements, and the like; we share work 
                    and perspectives with these teams as a way to strengthen the coherence of our Systems, as well as to utilize and 
                    build on each otherâ€™s work. These teams are currently M365, O365, and Dynamics.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Fabric is the platform we use for our controls and patterns. We reuse as much as possible,
                    while tailoring where we need to for our customers, and where applicable guidance is missing.</p>
