# Introduction
The Coherence team, a part of Shared Services Engineering Studio, is developing the CSEO Design System.
A Design System is a coherent, reusable set of patterns, components, and predictable concepts that cohere not just elements or experiences but meaning that scales across product families, consisting of:
* **Design Toolkit** comprised of styles, colors, type ramp, icons, grid and layout templates
* **UI Control Library** comprised of robust, up-to-date components to build web and mobile experiences with.

# Overview 
 
The CSEO Design System is a product that serves other products. Our team works in partnership with product teams to provide tools and guidance that ensure coherency across our varied products and familiarity with the larger Microsoft product ecosystem. 
 
**For the Organization**
 Design Systems increase efficiencies and reduce guesswork, allowing teams to move more quickly and confidently.
 
**For our Customers**
 Design Systems increase usability and trust by making experiences familiar and consistent, and meeting the bar for quality and brand set by Microsoft.
 
Design Systems are the heart of Modern product-making culture. By their nature, Design Systems are ever-evolving, and their success depends on the collaboration and contributions from everyone who uses them; A Design System is a product co-owned by everyone.
 
# Principles
 
Fluent is the Design language of Microsoft. From a systems standpoint, we are part of a federated community of products that share similar patterns, development requirements, and customer scenarios - We share work and perspectives with these teams as a way to strengthen the coherence of the system at a macro level, and also learn form each other‚Äôs work. These teams are M365, O365, and Dynamics.
 
We use Fabric as the execution platform for controls and patterns. We layer on top of this our own developing CSEO POV, which is informed by the specific needs of our customers. We reinvent as little as possible, Using resources and direction that the company has already defined, while also recognizing that we need to tailor existing work to serve the specific needs of our customers.
